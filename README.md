# Welcome to Cryptography and Networking!

This site will serve as a resource for any topics and materials discussed throughout the course.

## Features
Navigation bar will consist of list items with drop downs. Each dropdown will correspond
to a chapter and populate key terms & definitions.

There will be a flashcard endpoint where you can test your knowledge on the key terms.
Cards flip on user touch and can be navigated through using the implemented carousel buttons.

### Special Note
I will be updating this site accordingly as I go through the material in hopes that I have
the availability and liberty to do so. If you have any feedback and suggestions, please feel free
to reach out. Best of luck!
